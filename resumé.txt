    1_memento: to implement undo mecanism 

    2_state: methods behaves diffenrently depending on 
    the tool we are using (using polymorphisme) (one state =>canvas)
    
    3_iterator:  histroy in web browser (to support the
    changement in data structure to store list of urls
    ex: just need for 10 last url visited => use String[10])
    th main class is not affected
   
    4_strategy: store the images of the user upload
    (compressing and applying filters) (multiple state => compressor & filter)

    5_command: graphical user framwwork(), when we have a button that
    execute differents jobs depending on where we call it
    decopling the invoker (sender) from the receiver
    main benefits: 
    -decoupling the sender from the reciver
    * store them and execute them in the future
    * ability to make undo mecanisms
    - keep track of all commands that have been executed and replay them
